# JavaScript-Trainning
This is the repository to test my JavaScript applications.

I found myself hard to learn JavaScript. So I began to study from the begining. 

Here I have included the source code of all the source codes in the development process in my self learning outcome.
1. Hello World
2. Variables
3. Data types
4. Operators
5. Events
6. Functions
7. Multiple parameters
8. Arrays
9. Nested - if statements
